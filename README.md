# Project Decomissioned with message from up-to-now author and maintainer

This project has been decomissioned. I, James Sumners, took it on when it was
languishing without any maintenance as it filled a need in the ecosystem and
I had built things at a prior organization that depended upon this project.
I spent a lot of time triaging issues and reworking things toward a path
that could be more easily maintained by a community of volunteers. But I have
not had the time to dedicate to this project in quite a while. 

There are outstanding issues that would take me at least a week of dedicated development
time to solve, and I cannot afford to take time off of work to do that.
Particularly considering that the aforementioned organization was two
jobs ago, and it is extremely unlikely that I will transition to a role again
that will need this project.
